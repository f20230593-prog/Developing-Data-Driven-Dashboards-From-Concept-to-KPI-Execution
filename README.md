# Developing-Data-Driven-Dashboards-From-Concept-to-KPI-Execution
Project Overview:
This repository contains all dashboards and related resources developed during my Practice School-I internship at Ink In Caps (IIC) Interactive Labs Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai as part of my B.E. Computer Science program at BITS Pilani.
The project focuses on creating interactive, data-driven dashboards that transform raw business and marketing data into actionable insights. Using Power BI and Looker Studio, I built visualizations tailored to specific KPIs, enabling strategic decision-making.

Objectives:
Integrate diverse data sources into BI tools.
Perform data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
Design efficient data models for faster processing and insightful analytics.
Develop visually compelling dashboards aligned with business goals.
Transition dashboards from Power BI to Looker Studio for enhanced interactivity and layout flexibility.

Tools & Technologies:
Power BI (Web Version)
Looker Studio
Power Query for ETL
DAX Functions for calculated measures
Data sources: CSV, Excel, API-based connections (as applicable).

Features :
Dynamic KPI Tracking: Real-time monitoring of business metrics.
Data Cleaning Pipelines: Standardized datasets for accuracy.
Cross-Platform Dashboards: Seamless migration between BI tools.
User-Friendly Visuals: Optimized for non-technical stakeholders.
